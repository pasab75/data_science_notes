  # $ marks the end of the line
  #   I doubt it$
  #   He said, she said, I doubt it (match)
  #   I doubt it! (no match)
  # [] Will make a list of characters acceptable, including range [0-9][a-z][A-Z][a-zA-Z] as examples
  # Inside [] the ^ negates the acceptable range
  #   [^?.]$ says lines that don't end with ? or .
  # . means any character
  #   so 9.11
  #     is looking for something like 9T11
  # | is the or operator
  #   flood|fire
  #     looks for either fire or flood in a line
  # alternatives can also be there own regex
  #   ^[Gg]ood|[Bbad]
  #     looks for either good a the beginning of the line, or bad anywhere
  # parentheses give you alternatives that obey outer conditions
  #   ^([Gg]ood|[Bbad])
  #     looks for good or bad at the beginning of the line
  # next to () the ? is an optional
  #   George( [Ww]\.)? Bush
  #     looks for george bush with or without a W. w.
  #     note the escape (the \) . is a special character so to use it as a literal it must be escaped
  # the * sign is look for the proceeding character any number of times
  #   (.*)
  #     look for any character any number of times
  # the + sign says at least 1 must exist
  #   [0-9]+
  #     at least 1 number
  # {num, num} lets you set the number of matches you want
  #   (a|b){1,5}
  #     look for 1 to 5 a or b characters in a row
  # {num} look for exactly this number of matches
  # {num, } look for at least this number of matches
  # the \num will look for repeats of the previous evaluation
  #   +([a-zA-Z]+) +\1 +
  #     time for bed, night night twitter (matches)
  # * is greedy, will match on the longest possible string that satisfies it, unless turned off with ?
